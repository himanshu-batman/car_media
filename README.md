1) Banner background-image in Find Your Dream car section is not their in zeplin, 
   so i download Somewhat Similer image and used in this task.
   
2) In Find Your Dream car section Drop-Down i only created the design and structure for 
   showing option values we can create ul li's and toogle their appearance,
   also i try with Select and option tag i achive the style but in mobile view the option content
   appered larger size. so, i try diffrent approch and with help of javascript we can achive that select and option functionality.
   
3) Commented the necessary things which helps during code review.

4) for Slider i used slick Slider because of pluging some styles we can't override so i used !importent in css.

5)  In Find Your Dream car section after certain viewport width i remove the hero img because 
    as per my website visual design point and related content in mobile view we don't needed that image 
    beacuse user now have full view for selecting and finding cars.. no need to catch users eyes.
    
    
    thank you..
